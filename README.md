# Racing Drones Description
These images are of the first racing drone we had built as a team. It had LED lights (which were actually pretty beautiful, but hard to see in the daylight), 4 motors with 4 propellers attached, and a suboptimal flight hub (power board and flight controller with right angle male headers were extremely squished together if I remember correctly).

# How We Got the Money to Build Racing Drones
Can't really leave this part out. In my junior year, our team had 20-30 members. We were broke, but we really wanted to build racing drones. So we did the natural thing and presented to a panel of 4 judges from the Wild River Community Foundation<sup>TM</sup> in Del Norte who then gave us a $30,000 grant to fulfill our dreams. Then we built the drones. A lot of them.

# Test Flight Recordings
I cannot include the test flight recordings we conducted because their file sizes are quite large, and there is some inappropriate language in some of them.

Most of the time, we couldn't even get the drone to lift up off of the ground, so maybe you can sympathize with us. Sometimes the FrSky controller wasn't able to communicate with the on-board flight controller, other times the propellers were placed incorrectly, the gigantic battery ran out of juice, or the drone would lift up off the ground, and immediately crash right after. Not even going to mention the number of propellers we collectively broke.

# What We Learned
Creating a drone isn't easy. It takes a lot of dedication, patience, collaboration, and teamwork. The best part of the whole process, however, was finally getting the drone to fly. We had FatShark goggles to look through the on-board camera and it was amazing! We flew over the school's football, baseball, and soccer fields so we wouldn't injure anyone, but seeing it fly for the first time was really exciting, let alone the tricks we did with it.
